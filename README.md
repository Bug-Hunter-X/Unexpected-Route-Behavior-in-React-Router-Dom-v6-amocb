# React Router Dom v6 Unexpected Route Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in React Router Dom v6.  Routes render correctly, but after navigation, there's no way to return to the previous route, even with the browser's back button.

## Bug Description

Routes are defined and displayed correctly. However, after navigating to a different route, using the browser's back button or any other standard method doesn't revert to the previous route. This issue only arises when using React Router v6 and seems related to how navigation history is handled.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Navigate between the Home and About pages.
2. Try using the browser's back button to return to the previous page.  It will likely fail.

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js` and demonstrates a way to handle navigation history more effectively with React Router v6, potentially avoiding this issue.
